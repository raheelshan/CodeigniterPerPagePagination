CodeigniterPerPagePagination
============================

This class works only with segments for now and has per page functionality to be selected dynamically by user

This class takes an array like this.

$config['display_items_array'] = array(5,10,15,20);

Now calling perpage_links() method of this class will generate links for perpage.
